"""Where a game's manual is, or would go.

A manual sits beside its game, or in a "manuals" folder next to it, named like
the game with a document's extension. Collections rarely name the two exactly
alike - "Sonic The Hedgehog 2 (World) (Rev A).md" against "Sonic The Hedgehog 2
(World).pdf" - so names are also compared with their bracketed tags removed.

Paths are Kodi's, which may be URLs, so they are joined with "/" and never
handed to os.path. Nothing here touches the filesystem: listing a folder is
the caller's job, passed in, so this can be tested without Kodi.
